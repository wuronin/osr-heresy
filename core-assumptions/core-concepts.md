# Core Concepts

There rare some concepts which are referenced multiple times in my other contents, instead of repeating myself every time I will explain all of them once in this page.

### Rank

The **rank** of a PC is the number of times they have improved their saves and hit progression compared to a "common human", this concept is often used in my other contents so it was moved to "core" :

| Rank | 3x \* | 4x \*\* | 5 \*\* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1-3 | 1-4 | 1-5 |
| 2 | 4-6 | 5-8 | 6-10 |
| 3 | 7-9 | 9-12 | 11-16 |
| 4 | 10-12 | 13+ | 17+ |
| 5 | 13+ | - | - |

3x: Fighter, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling. Classes that "advance" every 3 levels.

4x: Cleric, Thief. Classes that "advance" every 4 levels.

5x: Magic-User. Classes that "advance" every 5 levels.
