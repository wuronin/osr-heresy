# Halfling Genocide

Halfling are always the in-game proof that even gods can be wrong. 

Every setting I homebrew for BECMI has an in-game genocide for this useless species. 

More or less it always goes like this: 

After the creation of the multiverse the gods were pleased of their work and having a feast, one of them was looking at the prime plane when they noticed a mistake in the creation: the halfling species.

Gods sent their avatars and solved the issue, but even them were unable to avoid the shame of making this mistake. All sentient species still remember when the hafling roamed the world and this is something that cannot be forgot or dismissed: Even the gods may be wrong.

### Variants

For one shots or less serious games several variant of the halfling mistake have been used over the years, this is a short list of valid solutions:

* They were used as target practice for fun, everybody miss the "good old days" when you could shoot an hafling after a bad day.
* They were a dragon delicacy and everybody else was quite happy to befriend dragons and feed them, when the halflings were over dragons became more aggressive and hostile \(i.e. went back to the default "D&D behaviour".
* The ashes of an hafling could be used as a perfect _contraceptive ****_like its historical counterpart the Silphium they went extinct. If you are using this variant haflings were a gift from a god instead of a mistake.
* Killing an halfling reduced the amount of dirt/dust gathered in the house no matter how often you clean, so people decided that it was better to have clean buildings than halflings around. Legend says that there are still some hidden somewhere and this is why we still need to clean.
* Somebody made the wish: "Make the world a better place". There is a statue of this unnamed wizard in every main city to remember this achievement.
* Halflingness was a magical curse like being a were-creature or an undead spawn. Luckly it was heradicated long time ago.
* They were too useless and lazy to actually work so they all starved to death and gods forbid everybody to help them because their squealing was amusing.
* An ancient sport called "halfling kicking" was invented, halfling were bouncy and soft but not really able to survive even a single match. Nowdays they have been replaced by a thing called "ball".
