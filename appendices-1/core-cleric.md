# \* The Cleric is not fine

## Short Version

Clerics use the Fighter XP table. 

Cleric spells must be learned using the same rules as wizards \(research, mentors, scrolls or level up\), they have not an innate knowledge of all the spells.

Inverted spells must be learned as distinct spells from their "normal" version. There is no level restriction on using them.

### Motivations

The original cleric class received several buffs over time because few players wanted to play it and because some rules got lost over the editions. I disagree with these changes.

A nice effect of bumping their XP progression is that almost all the "glitches" were the cleric has more HP than the fighters or the saves jump around disappear. 

The spell restrictions have 2 reasons behind them:

1. Enabling a control over which spells will appear in the game.
2. Reducing the choice paralysis. Clerics often feel overhelming because they need to know a lot more information than other classes.
3. It will give your PCs a reason to engage in spell research or befriend churches/temples.
4. It can be used to easily create religion-specific "themes" by altering which spells they favour. 

The change applied to inverted spells is only to make it more clear. Spell inversion as explained in the rules is often misunderstood or ignored by players and DMs alike.
