# HD overloads

Becmi has little use for the class HD other than using them to define the character HP total.

Here is a short list of overloads for your games.

## HD as Recovery

Use the Class HD instead of D6 for any kind of healing effect like spells, potions or natural healing. 

Natural healing is HALF the class HD \(default is 1d3 HP / day\).
