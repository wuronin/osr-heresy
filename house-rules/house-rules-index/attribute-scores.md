# Attribute Scores

A few ways to reduce the randomness in chargen or alter how PCs work.

### Clamped scores

Roll your 3d6 in order. Find your modifier and subtract it from the score. Than use this second score as usual. This removes the "extreme" results making things like the Skill Checks more predictable and reduce the chance to have "hopeless" PCs along superheroes. 

| Original Score / Modifier | Final Score / Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| 3 \(-3\) or 4 \(-2\) | 6 \(-1\) |
| 5 \(-2\) or 6 \(-1\) | 7 \(-1\) |
| 7 \(-1\) | 8 \(-1\) |
| 8 \(-1\) | 9 \(+0\) |
| 9-12 \(+0\) | Unchanged 9-12 \(+0\) |
| 13 \(+1\) | 12 \(+0\) |
| 14 \(+1\) | 13 \(+1\) |
| 15 \(+1\), 16 \(+2\) | 14 \(+1\) |
| 17 \(+2\), 18 \(+3\) | 15 \(+1\) |

### Growing Scores

Roll your 3d6 in order as usual. Every level after the first roll 2d6, each D6 can be used to:

1\) Raise the potential score by \[result\] - Current Modifier \(Up to max 18\). 

2\) Raise the score by \[result\] up to your potential score.

3\) Raise your hp maximum by \[result\] up to your class max value for the current level.

If your prefer a less pronounced growth just give 1d6 for each level up after the first.
