# OSR Heresy Homepage

This site is only a way to collect a translation of my own creations and make them available as shareable links for people asking about them on reddit, forums or other sources.

Consider this website a permanent work-in-progress I will probably fill it as needed to support my activities in various online groups.

### The Site Structure and the Star System

Contents are grouped in different Categories:

* **Core Assumptions:** "Always On" variants or concepts, if you are not using them you will have to do some work to adapt my contents. 
* **House Rules:** Self contained variants.
* **Homebrews:** Bundles of variants or more complex alteration that requires or references one or more house rules to create a specific game experience or highlights some tones or "feeling".
* **Appendices:** External links or references to give credits when due.
* **Essays and Rants:** Random personal thoughts or opinions. Most of them will be created to explain the logic or motivation behind some change without polluting the variant page \(and boring casual readers\).
* **Unsorted:** Uncategorized contents will be stored here until I can find a proper location for them, everything under this category should be seen as a draft or a work in progress.&gt;:

### Disclaimer

The rules are based on "Classic D&D" \(Rules Cyclopedia and BECMI\), they should be compatible with B/X or the recent OSE but I will not do any effort to keep them totally in line with the current "trends" or "standards".

When the original source or inspiration can be traced to another blog or forum post I will try to give proper credit.
