# OSR Heresy Homepage

This site is only a way to collect a translation of my own creations and make them available as shareable links for people asking about them on reddit, forums or other sources.

Consider this website a permanent work-in-progress I will probably fill it as needed to support my activities in various online groups.

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Disclaimer

The rules are wrote using "Classic D&D" \(Rules Cyclopedia and BECMI\) as the reference source material, they be mostly compatible with B/X or the recent OSE but I will not do any effort to keep them totally in line with the current "trends" or "standards".

When the original source or inspiration can be traced to another blog or forum post I will try to give proper credit.
