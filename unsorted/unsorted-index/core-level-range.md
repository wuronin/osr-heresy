# Restricted Level Range

## Short Version

PCs start at level 3 and may aquire only up to 600'000 XP.

This means that the planned level range is 3 - 12 with few exceptions.

### Long Version

A common house rule is to start from level 3 to have "competent" PCs leaving level 1-2 to NPCs.

Ther 600'000 XP limit has few interesting properties when used with my other core assumptions:

1. Fighters can raise up to level 12.
2. Magic-Users can raise up to level 11 \(Their name level, also their last improvement in terms of saves and to hit ability\).
3. Elves can raise up to level 10 \(Their level cap\)
4. Dwarves can raise up to level 11. A nice thing here is that due to their additional HP/level they will have exactly the same HP range and "Thac0" of a level 12 fighter.

The notable exceptions are:

1. Clerics which should be level 13 when using the original XP progression \(fixed under another core assumptions\)
2. Thieves who should be almost level 13 \(but miss 40'000 XP to get there\)
3. Halflings who will reach their level limit \(8\) at 120'000 XP and be left behind.

In my games I also cap the PC level to 12 and restrict the 13+ range to NPCs and monsters, this make it possible to have legendary items, fantastic scrolls and the occasional "wish" without having to worry about players being able to eventually be some kind of super hero.

Level 12 has a few properties that can actually improve your games a lot: 

1. Fighters, Elves
2. At 600'000xp Cleric will be level 13, Magic-Users level 11

Level 1 is used to represent non-combatants, any human-sized creature will be a "Level 1" character, if they aquire an adventurer class they combine the class traits with their default ones.

Level 2 is the difference between a commoner/civilian and somebody with at least a minimum of combat training. Novice guards and apprentice adventurers often fall in this category.

Level 3-4 is the usual range for veteran and trained combatants, quite often adventurers 

From a worldbuilding perLevels 1-2 and 13+ may still be used for NPCs and monsters following these guidelines:

1. Any adult humanoid of human size is a "Level 1" character.
2. Any combatant receive at least 1 additional level/HD for their training. A "beginner/apprentice" adventurer will be Level 2 instead of Level 1.
3. Any veteran/fully trained combat or adventurer will be at least Level 3.
4. The usual population is never going to raise over Level 5, overcoming this "gate" is only possible with actual combat experience.
5. NPCs and monsters can still raise after 







### What does it change?

Beginning PCs at level 3 remove the "funnel effect" and give each player a bit more toys to play with from the start. 

Each HD range has specific meaning / value which is useful to create your own ruling.

Removing the really high-level stuff from the hand of

Every human sized creature will have 1 HD before any kind of training. Using this as the default value
