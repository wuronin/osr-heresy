# Core Concepts

There rare some concepts which are referenced multiple times in my other contents, instead of repeating myself every time I will explain all of them once in this page.

### Boon / Banes

D&D 5e introduced the concept of Advantage / Disadvantage explained in its [SRD](https://5thsrd.org/rules/advantage_and_disadvantage/). 

I am using the same concept but renamed it Boon/Bane because it is more brief and I can simply write +B and -B instead of trying to abbreviate advantage / disadvantage and extending it to cover non d20 rolls.

+B means roll an additional dice \(usually 1d20\) and discard the lowest die to get your result.

-B means roll an additional dice \(usually 1d20\) and discard the highest die to get your result.

Using this form makes explaining a lot of rules easier and open the ability to "chain" multiple boons or have a clean way to evaluate how boon & banes interact when they appear together. \(Usually they cancel each other\)

Few examples:

1. The usual creation method: Roll 4d6 and keep the highest 3 can be expressed as 3d6+1d6B.
2. You could have random bonus added to a reaction roll expressed as 2d6+1d8B \(roll all of them and discard the lower die\).
3. You could have complex variants that mix boon and banes like: 2d6+1d8B-2d4B. This would be solved by rolling all the 5 dice, discard the lowest \(+B\) and than the 2 highest \(-2B\).

### Character Rank

The **rank** of a PC is the number of times they have improved their saves and hit progression compared to a "common human", this concept is often used in my other contents so it was moved to "core" :

| Rank | 3x \* | 4x \*\* | 5 \*\* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1-3 | 1-4 | 1-5 |
| 2 | 4-6 | 5-8 | 6-10 |
| 3 | 7-9 | 9-12 | 11-16 |
| 4 | 10-12 | 13+ | 17+ |
| 5 | 13+ | - | - |

3x: Fighter, Dwarf, Elf, Halfling. Classes that "advance" every 3 levels.

4x: Cleric, Thief. Classes that "advance" every 4 levels.

5x: Magic-User. Classes that "advance" every 5 levels.
