# BECMI Save Progressions

The saves tables in BECMI were changed multiple times and sometimes even within the same book.

If you have a look at the Table shown in the Expert Page 29 and compare the information with the class entries:

| Class | X Class entries | X29 / CM25 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fighter Rank 5 | 4/5/6/7/8 | 6/6/7/8/9 |
| Cleric Rank 4 | 5/6/8/10/9 | 6/7/8/10/9 |

Note: The Rules Cyclopedia use the X29 Tables in the Class entries.

This table shows how many points of improvement each class get to their saves expressed as Total / Difference with the previous Rang & Average.

| **Rank** | Cleric | Fighter | Magic-User | Thief |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 \(Common Human\) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 11 / - / 2.2  | 9 / - / 1.8 | 8 / - / 1.6 | 8 / - / 1.6 |
| 2 | 21 / +10 / +4.2 | 19 / +10 / +3.8 | 19 / +10 / +3.8 | 18 / +10 / +3.6 |
| 3 | 31 / +10 / +6.2 | 29 / +10 / +5.8 | 30 / +11 / +6 | 28 / +10 / +5.6 |
| 4 | 39 / +8 / +7.8 | 39 / +8 / +7.8 | - | 38 / +10 / +7.6 |
| 4a \(Old Cleric\) | 41 / +10 / +8.2 | 43 / +4 / +8.6 | - | - |
| 5 | - | 43 / +4 / +8.6 | - | - |
| 5a \(Old X version\) | - | 49 / +10 / +9.8 | - | - |

Looking at the tables it also easy to notice that:

1. The cleric get a +1 to the first 2 saves at ranks 1-3, this bonus is lost at rank 4 in the revised table.
2. The fighter gets Breath and Spells "swapped" compared to everybody else.
3. The magic-user get a +1 vs spells at rank 3.
4. The magic-user and thief have the 2nd and 3rd saves "swapped" compared to the fighter and cleric.
5. The thief should get a +1 to some save to 

### End notes

In the basic set the "UC" saves had a 18 score vs spells. This explain why the fighter improvement is always ending with a 9. If they kept the previous value the fighter would have a round number of +10 / +2 at every rank.

An interesting bit is that when they went from OD&D to B/X they have chosen to make every progression slower to have more levels. All the tables could be expressed as a simple formula : 

Fighters: + Level \*2/3 or 2\* Rank.

Clerics/Thieves: Level \* 1/2 or +2\* Rank.

Magic-Users: + Level \* 2/5 or +2\* Rank.
